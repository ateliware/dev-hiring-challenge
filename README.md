# TrioTest

Hi guys, I'm Caio Cozza.

Don't mind my ugly frontend since my experience is 100% backend based (C, C++, Python, Node).

I've made the backend using Typescript and with a framework called Nest.js.
The frontend is pretty basic and it's written with React. Besides my very basic knowledge of frontend I could read the docs and implement something.

Check out my github and my medium page :)
